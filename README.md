# Network Traffic Analysis Tool

## 📌 Overview
This project is a basic Python-based tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic.  
It’s designed to help beginners understand how network packets are structured and how to extract meaningful data from them using Python and libraries like **Scapy**.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in:
- Capturing network packets
- Filtering traffic by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP)
- Extracting useful information like source/destination IP addresses, ports, and packet sizes
- Understanding network monitoring basics

---

## 🚀 Features
- Capture live network traffic
- Filter packets by protocol
- Display key packet details
- Save captured data to a file for further analysis

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/) - for packet sniffing and analysis
